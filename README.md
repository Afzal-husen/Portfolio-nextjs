This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

After completing my 12th science examination with a score of 70%, I pursued a degree in aeronautical engineering. However, I eventually realized that it was not my true passion and decided to drop out of the program. I began tutoring students in the field of science and mathematics, which gave me a new perspective on teaching and learning. After a year of tutoring, I stumbled upon the world of coding and immediately became hooked. I started learning programming languages on my own and discovered a new passion that I had never felt before. Today, I continue to study and develop my coding skills while pursuing my career in the tech indust

I dropped out of aeronautical engineering after passing my 12th science examination with 70%. I began tutoring for a year before discovering my love for coding. I taught myself using both free and paid resources like YouTube and Udemy. Now, I pursue a career in tech. -->
